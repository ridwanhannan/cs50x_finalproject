My project is called the covid-19 tracker. It is a simple web interface, based in the web distribution of CS50 tracks that allows users to login or create an account then track the live stats of
covid-19 catered towards their specific countries of choice. So if one person checks Australia and USA frequently these can be viewed together on a separate page which outputs results from an SQL database. 
The data is also being received through an API call so the coronavirus stats are being updated every 15 mintues.
